    <h2>Autonomous Rover</h2>
    <p>This was a group project where I helped built an autonomous rover using Arduino and Solidworks. <br> In this project, I was tasked with designing the rover's schematics and designing its parts on <br>
    Solidworks. My job was also to help assemble the parts and ensure the functionality was as <br> intended for our rover. In the end, we were able to design a fully functioning autonomous rover <br> that could trace through a maze on its own.</p>
